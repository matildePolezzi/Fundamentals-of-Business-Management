# Fundamentals of Business Management Project - Challenge 2024/2025

# Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the HACKATHON "Learning by Doing is a Challenge!" in collaboration with AI-LOG. Our task was to solve Business Case 3: Budgeting and Forecasting.

To tackle this challenge, we chose Fiasconaro, a leading company in the panettone industry, and conducted a budget analysis to gain insights into its financial performance. We then developed forecasting models using time series analysis to predict future trends. Finally, we designed a mockup application that integrates all these components into a cohesive solution.
